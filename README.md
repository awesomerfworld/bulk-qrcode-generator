# bulk_qrCode_generator
This is a simple application to generate bulk QR Code. I made this application to make asset number labelling easier.

Some field must be fill,

 - Prefix
 - Start Number
 - End Number

E.g :
 - Prefix : AIND-00
 - Start Number : 1
 - End Number : 20
 - **Result : AIND-001 until AIND-0020**
